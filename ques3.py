# Problem 3: Update no of items available
# Suppose you are given a list of candy and another list of same size representing no of items of respective candy.

# i.e -

# candy_list = ['Jelly Belly','Kit Kat','Double Bubble','Milky Way','Three Musketeers']
# no_of_items = [10,20,34,74,32]
# Write a program to show no. of items of each candy type.

# Output:

# Jelly Belly-10
# Kit Kat-20
# Double Bubble-34
# Milky Way-74
# Three Musketeers-32

# method1
candy_list = ['Jelly Belly','Kit Kat','Double Bubble','Milky Way','Three Musketeers']
no_of_items = [10,20,34,74,32] 
# [i for i in candy_list]
left=[list(i) for  i in zip(candy_list,no_of_items)]
# print(left)
for i in left:
    print(f"{i[0]}-{i[1]}")



# method2
candy_list = ['Jelly Belly','Kit Kat','Double Bubble','Milky Way','Three Musketeers']
no_of_items = [10,20,34,74,32]

for candy, items in zip(candy_list, no_of_items):
    print(f"{candy}-{items}")
